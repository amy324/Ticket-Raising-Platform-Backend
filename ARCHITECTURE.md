# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
The architecture of the ticket raising platform is designed to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability. It follows a modular structure, separating concerns into distinct components to facilitate development, testing, and deployment.

## Components

### 1. **Backend Server**
   - **Description:** The backend server serves as the core component of the platform, handling HTTP requests, business logic, and data persistence.
   - **Technology Stack:** Golang programming language, Gorilla Mux for routing, and standard library for HTTP handling.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Authentication and authorization of users.
     - Ticket management, including creation, retrieval, and closure.
     - Integration with the MySQL database for data storage.
     - Implementation of RESTful API endpoints for client-server communication.
     - Error handling and logging.

### 2. **Database**
   - **Description:** The database stores persistent data related to users, tickets, conversations, and access tokens.
   - **Technology Stack:** MySQL relational database management system.
   - **Schema Design:**
     - Tables: Users, Tickets, Conversations, Access Tokens.
     - Relationships: One-to-many relationships between users and tickets, tickets and conversations.
     - Indexing: Indexes on frequently queried columns for performance optimization.

### 3. **Authentication**
   - **Description:** The authentication component manages user authentication and token-based authorization.
   - **Technology Stack:** Custom authentication middleware implemented in Golang.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Token generation and validation using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
     - Role-based access control (RBAC) for distinguishing between regular users and administrators.
     - Refresh token mechanism for prolonging session validity.

### 4. **External Services**
   - **Description:** External services are integrated to enhance platform functionality, such as email notification simulation.
   - **Technology Stack:** Mailtrap for simulating email delivery.
   - **Usage:**
     - Sending notification emails to users or administrators for ticket updates, account actions, etc.

## Deployment
The ticket raising platform is deployed on a cloud hosting service for accessibility and scalability. Currently, it is hosted on Render, providing a reliable environment for running the backend server and connecting to the MySQL database. 

## Future Considerations

In its current state, this project serves as a demonstration of backend development skills, providing a platform for testing APIs using tools like Postman. However, in a real-world scenario, several enhancements and best practices would be implemented to ensure scalability, security, and reliability. The following considerations outline key areas for improvement and the reasons behind their implementation:

- **Scaling:** Horizontal scaling strategies would be employed to accommodate increased user traffic and workload demands efficiently. This ensures that the application can handle growth without sacrificing performance or availability.
  
- **Security:** Robust security measures, including HTTPS encryption, input validation, and secure password storage techniques, would be implemented to protect user data from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. This helps safeguard sensitive information and maintains user trust.
  
- **Monitoring:** Integration of monitoring tools allows for real-time performance tracking, error detection, and resource utilization analysis. This proactive approach helps identify and address issues promptly, ensuring optimal system performance and reliability.
  
- **Containerization:** Containerizing the application using Docker provides portability and consistency across different environments, simplifying deployment and management tasks. This allows for easier scaling, versioning, and maintenance of the application components.
  
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implementation of a CI/CD pipeline automates the testing and deployment processes, reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of human error. This enables rapid and reliable delivery of updates and enhancements to the application.
  
- **User Data Protection:** Compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA, ensures the privacy and security of user data. Strict measures are implemented to safeguard personal information, including encryption, access controls, and data anonymization where applicable.
  
- **API Testing:** Comprehensive API testing suites are employed to validate functionality, performance, and reliability. Automated tests cover various scenarios and edge cases, ensuring that APIs behave as expected and meet the specified requirements.
  
- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Strengthened authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), and fine-grained authorization controls are implemented to enforce access restrictions based on user roles and permissions. This enhances security and ensures that users only have access to the resources they are authorized to use.
