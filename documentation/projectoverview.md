# Project Overview

## Introduction

The ticket-raising platform project is a backend application developed to serve as a portfolio piece demonstrating best practices in Golang backend development. The project aims to showcase the design, implementation, and deployment of a scalable, secure, and efficient backend system for managing support tickets.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the project are:

1. **Backend Development Proficiency**: Demonstrate proficiency in Golang backend development by designing and implementing a robust and feature-rich backend application.

2. **Scalability and Performance**: Showcase the ability to design a scalable and performant backend architecture capable of handling increasing user traffic and ticket volumes.

3. **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect user data, authenticate and authorize users securely, and prevent common security vulnerabilities.

4. **API Design and Documentation**: Design a clean, intuitive, and well-documented API interface for interacting with the backend services, adhering to RESTful principles and industry best practices.

5. **Deployment and DevOps**: Showcase expertise in deployment and DevOps practices by deploying the backend application to a cloud hosting service and configuring continuous integration and delivery pipelines.

## Features

The ticket-raising platform backend offers the following key features:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**: Implement token-based authentication and authorization mechanisms to securely authenticate users and enforce access control policies.

2. **Ticket Management**: Provide endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and closing support tickets. Implement features for categorizing tickets, tracking their status, and managing ticket queues efficiently.

3. **Real-Time Communication**: Enable real-time communication between users and support staff through messaging features embedded within ticket threads.

4. **Email Notifications**: Implement email notification functionalities to keep users informed about ticket updates, status changes, and other relevant events.

5. **Data Persistence and Management**: Utilize a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL) for storing and managing persistent data related to users, tickets, conversations, and access tokens.

6. **Logging and Error Handling**: Implement logging mechanisms to track application events and errors effectively, facilitating troubleshooting and debugging.

## Technologies Used

The ticket-raising platform backend is built using the following technologies:

- **Programming Language**: Golang
- **Web Framework**: Gorilla Mux for routing
- **Database**: MySQL for realtional data storage
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization, Render for cloud hosting


## Conclusion

The ticket-raising platform backend project serves as a showcase of Golang backend development skills and expertise. By implementing a feature-rich backend application with a focus on scalability, security, and performance, the project demonstrates the ability to deliver high-quality backend solutions that meet the needs of modern web applications.
