# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
The architecture of the ticket-raising platform prioritizes scalability, reliability, and maintainability. It embraces a modular structure, dividing responsibilities into distinct components to facilitate development, testing, and deployment processes.

## Components

### 1. **Backend Server**
   - **Description:** The backend server serves as the core of the platform, managing HTTP requests, business logic, and data storage.
   - **Technology Stack:** Utilizes the Golang programming language, Gorilla Mux for routing, and standard HTTP handling libraries.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - User authentication and authorization.
     - Ticket lifecycle management (creation, retrieval, closure).
     - Integration with a MySQL database for persistent data storage.
     - Implementation of RESTful API endpoints for client-server communication.
     - Error handling and logging functionalities.

### 2. **Database**
   - **Description:** The database stores crucial data related to users, tickets, conversations, and access tokens.
   - **Technology Stack:** Relies on the MySQL relational database management system.
   - **Schema Design:**
     - Tables include Users, Tickets, Conversations, and Access Tokens.
     - Relationships established via one-to-many relationships between users and tickets, tickets and conversations.
     - Indexes optimized for frequently queried columns to enhance performance.

### 3. **Authentication**
   - **Description:** Manages user authentication and token-based authorization.
   - **Technology Stack:** Custom authentication middleware developed in Golang.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Token generation and validation using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
     - Role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate regular users from administrators.
     - Refresh token mechanism for extending session validity.

### 4. **External Services**
   - **Description:** External services augment platform functionality, such as simulating email notifications.
   - **Technology Stack:** Utilizes Mailtrap for email simulation.
   - **Usage:**
     - Sending notification emails to users or administrators for ticket updates, account actions, etc.

## Deployment
The ticket-raising platform is deployed on a cloud hosting service to ensure accessibility and scalability. Currently, it operates on Render, providing a dependable environment for running the backend server and connecting to the MySQL database.

## Future Considerations

While the current project serves as a showcase of backend development expertise, real-world scenarios demand additional enhancements and best practices to ensure scalability, security, and reliability. Key areas for improvement include:

- **Scaling:** Implementing horizontal scaling strategies to accommodate increased user traffic efficiently.
  
- **Security:** Strengthening security measures, including HTTPS encryption, input validation, and secure password storage.
  
- **Monitoring:** Integrating monitoring tools for real-time performance tracking and error detection.
  
- **Containerization:** Containerizing the application using Docker for improved portability and consistency.
  
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Establishing a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment processes.
  
- **User Data Protection:** Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and implementing strict data protection measures.
  
- **API Testing:** Employing comprehensive API testing suites to validate functionality and performance.
  
- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Enhancing authentication mechanisms and implementing fine-grained authorization controls.

## Conclusion
The architecture of the ticket-raising platform is meticulously designed to meet the demands of scalability, reliability, and security. By leveraging modular components, robust technologies, and industry best practices, the platform ensures seamless ticket management and user satisfaction.
