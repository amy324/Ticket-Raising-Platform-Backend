## Codebase Overview

The Ticket Platform codebase follows several Go programming language conventions, techniques, and methodologies:

- **Structs**: Structs are used to represent entities such as `User`, `Ticket`, `Conversation`, and `AccessToken`, providing a clean and organized way to define data structures.

- **Context**: The codebase utilizes the `context` package to manage context deadlines and cancellation, ensuring graceful handling of requests.

- **Middleware**: Middleware functions are employed for tasks such as user authentication and admin access validation, enhancing modularity and reusability.

- **Error Handling**: Error handling is implemented throughout the codebase using Go's built-in error handling mechanisms, such as `if err != nil`, to ensure robustness and reliability.

- **Database Interactions**: The application interacts with a MySQL database using the `database/sql` package, following best practices for database operations such as querying, inserting, and updating data.

- **Concurrency**: Go's concurrency features, such as goroutines and channels, are utilized where applicable to perform tasks concurrently, enhancing performance and responsiveness.

- **Logging**: The `log` package is used for logging informative messages and error details, aiding in debugging and monitoring the application.
